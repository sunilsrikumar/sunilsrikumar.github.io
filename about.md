Imagination is everything, it gives you a preview of coming life.

Founder and architect of Nescode – An internet engineering company. Started my career with HDFC Bank Ltd way back in 2007. In my degree days, I was blown away to discover a free operating system- Ubuntu that came with an editor, compiler, browser, media player and debugger—all of the tools you need to start a developer journey, and all of the source code! It was an incredible opportunity for a teenager in a small city like Patna(Bihar) to learn from the open platform. Sent an email to canonical and they were kind enough to send me bunch of CDs without any cost. Open source and Ubuntu bring a remarkable and unique viewpoint in my life in 2011 and if I remember correctly, since then I spent most of the time with open source technology.
