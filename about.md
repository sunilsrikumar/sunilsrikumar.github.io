Imagination is everything, it gives you a preview of coming life.

Founder and architect of Nescode – An internet engineering company. Started my career with HDFC Bank Ltd way back in 2007. Open source and Ubuntu bring a remarkable and unique viewpoint in my life in 2011 and if I remember correctly, since then I spent most of the time with open source technology.
